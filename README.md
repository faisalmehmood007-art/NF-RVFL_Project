# NF-RVFL Project: Dual-Phase Image Compression and Encryption

## Description
This project implements a **dual-phase image compression and encryption framework** using **Pell Q-Matrix** and **6D Hyperchaotic Dynamics**.  
It is designed for **secure and efficient multimedia transmission**, integrating advanced encryption with compression to reduce data size while maintaining security.
